I am attaching the sql script file for Basic CRM test in this repository.
The datase is created in an mssms 2019 with sql server vertion 15.


What is in the file?

    I have created Database and named it as # TL_Technologies. Which consists of two tables, one is #Customer_Table and the other one is # Order_Source.
The customer_table contains the columns which are Customer_Id(primary key), Customer_Name, Customer_Address, Customer_Phone(unique key). The Order_Source contains 
the columns which are Order_Id(primary key), Order_Date, Total_Order, Customer_Id(foreign key).
Stored Procedure are created for insert,update,delete, and read operations in both tables. 


    
Name of stored procedures and its usage.

    spInsertCustomer - This stored procedure is for inserting rows into customer_table. Which takes Customer_Name, Customer_Address, Customer_Phone as parameters.
    spUpdateCutomer - This stored procedure is for updating customer_table. Which takes Customer_Name, Customer_Address, Customer_Phone as parameters.
    spDeleteCustomer - This stored procedure is for deleting customer_table. Which takes Customer_Id as parameter for deleting that purticular row.
    spGetCustomer - This stored procedure is for reading the customer_table. Which takes Customer_Id as parameter for selecting that purticular row.
    spInsertOrder - This stored procedure is for inserting rows into Order_Source table.Which takes Order_Date, Total_Order, Customer_Id as parameters.
    spUpdateOrder - This stored procedure is for Updating Order_Source table. Which takes Order_Date, Total_Order, Customer_Id as parameters.
    spDeleteOrder - This stored procedure is for deleting Order_Source table. Which takes Order_Id as parameter for deleting that purticular row.
    spGetOrder - This stored procedure is for reading the Order_Source table. Which takes Order_Id as parameter for selecting that purticular row.
    
    
    
Common Table Expression.

    Common Table Expression(CTE) is implemented inside a stored procedure named #CustomersOrderDetails. By using this CTE we can get customer names and their total orders. 
    We can execute the stored procedure #CustomersOrderDetails without inputing any parameter and it shows all Customer_Name with Total_Order.
